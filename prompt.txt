Create Arduino code implementing motion sensor lamp. Assume motion sensor is connected to a pin able to wake up arduino from deep sleep. Assume analog pin is connected through voltage divider and measures lithium ion battery supply voltage. Assume motion detection trigger executes predefined envelope for voltage level measured during the trigger. Assume there are five envelopes. Let each envelope have 60 steps , each step having LED brighness and duration of step defined, with a looping point defined for each envelope executed in case another motion event is detected during execution of current envelope. Assume envelopes are stored as consts in PROGMEM.
